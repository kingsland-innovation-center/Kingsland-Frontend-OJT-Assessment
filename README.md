> https://api-demo.kingslandtesting.com/

You will need to call several routes via REST endpoints, tips are found throughout the codebase.

# The Assessment

You have the technical freedom to install any libraries that you deem fit for the tasks.

## Frontend

### First Task
The view components and routing have been made for you.

Your first task is to create a collapsible sidebar that links these pages together.

For the unauthenticated user, the sidebar menus should only be:
* Home
* Register
* Login

For the authenticated user, the sidebar menus are:
* A placeholder photo and the full name of the logged in user
* Dashboard
* Students
  * List
  * Add Student
* Logout

### Second Task

Attach the user interface interactions with their corresponding REST APIs.

| Interaction       | API                                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| User Registration | POST https://api-demo.kingslandtesting.com/user/register |
| User Login        | POST https://api-demo.kingslandtesting.com/user/login    |
| Add Student       | POST https://api-demo.kingslandtesting.com/student       |
| List All Students | GET https://api-demo.kingslandtesting.com/student/       |
